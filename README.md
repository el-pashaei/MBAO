## Mutation-based Binary Aquila optimizer for gene selection in cancer classification
A binary version of Aquila optimizer (BAO) is implemented to tackle Feature Selection(FS) problem for microarray data. 

This algorithm mimics the Aquila's behaviors in nature during the process of catching the prey. To build a Binary version of AO, twofold of adjustments were made: i) a time-varying mirrored S-shaped (TVMS) transfer function is utilized to transform the continues domain into a binary one. ii) A mutation operator is also suggested to ensure the efficiency of the proposed method for FS domain.
